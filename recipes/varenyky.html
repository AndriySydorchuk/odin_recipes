        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Start the dough.</strong> Combine 1 egg, 2/3 cup water, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a large bowl, and mix with a fork to incorporate the egg into the water. Add 1 cup flour, mix lightly to incorporate, then add 1 1/2 cups more flour. Combine into a shaggy dough – first working with the fork, then switching to using your hands.</li>

            <li><strong>Knead the dough.</strong> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead – giving the dough a quarter turn every now and then – for about 5 minutes. The dough is ready when it is smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky; if it’s sticking to your hands, gradually sprinkle on more flour and continue kneading. Then place the dough back in the bowl, cover loosely with a kitchen towel, and rest for 30 to 60 minutes.</li>

            <li><strong>Meanwhile, start the filling.</strong> Place the potatoes in a pot with 1 teaspoon salt and enough water to cover by about 1 inch. Cover with a lid, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, and simmer until the potatoes can be pierced easily with a fork, 12 to 15 minutes.</li>

            <li>Meanwhile, heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until they’re dark brown and a bit crispy, about 15 minutes.</li>

            <li><strong>Finish the filling.</strong> Drain the potatoes and return to the pot. Mash until smooth. Stir in about a third of the fried onions with their oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper (the potatoes should be really peppery!). Cool the mixture to room temperature.</li>

            <li><strong>Roll out the dough.</strong> Cut the dough into 4 portions. Working with 1 piece at a time (keeping the remaining dough covered with the towel), roll the dough between your palms into a 1-inch-thick log. On a floured surface, cut the log into 8 to 10 1-inch pieces. Using a rolling pin, roll out each piece into an approximately 3-inch circle; if the dough is sticking to the surface or rolling pin, dust it with more flour.</li>

            <li><strong>Form the varenyky.</strong> Make sure your filling has cooled to room temperature; otherwise; your dumplings will fall apart. Working with one circle at a time, place a heaping teaspoon of the filling into the center. Gather the dough into a half-moon shape around the filling and pinch the top closed (squeeze hard with your fingertips), then pinch both edges closed. Place the shaped varenik on a generously-floured baking sheet or cutting board, and continue filling the rest. Make sure the varenyky are not touching or they will stick together.</li>

            <li><strong>Boil the varenyky.</strong> Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it generously. Boil the varenyky in batches – about 10 at a time, depending on the size of your pot. Cook them for a few minutes, just until they float up to the surface. Once they have floated up and the water has returned to a steady simmer, cook them for another minute. (Do not overcook, as the filling may escape the dough.)</li>

            <li>Using a small mesh strainer or a slotted spoon, fish the varenyky out and place in a large bowl. Immediately add a small pat of butter (or a drizzle of oil) and gently toss to prevent the varenyky from sticking together. Continue cooking the remaining varenyky. At the end, add the remaining fried onions to the bowl and toss to coat.</li>

            <li>Serve immediately, with sour cream.</li>
