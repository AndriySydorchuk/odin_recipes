        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups shredded green cabbage (1/4 of a medium head, about 1 pound)</li>
            <li>1 medium carrot (4 to 5 ounces), peeled and grated</li>
            <li>1 large red beet (about 12 ounces), peeled and grated</li>
            <li>2 medium russet potatoes (1 pound), peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
            <li>1 medium onion (6 to 8 ounces), finely diced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons mild vinegar (like white, apple cider, or wine)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
            <li>10 black peppercorns</li>
            <li>4 medium garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice, to taste</li>
            <li>Dill and sour cream, for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="steps">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by prepping all the vegetables. (I highly recommend using a food processor, which makes this super easy. If you don’t have one, a sharp knife and a box grater will do. Be sure to process the beets last to avoid staining the other vegetables.) Begin with the slicing attachment and finely shred the cabbage. Then switch to the grating attachment and grate the carrot (you should end up with 1 cup). Then grate the beet (3 cups).</li>
    
            <li>Peel and chop the potatoes into 1-inch cubes. Peel and finely dice the onion.</li>
    
            <li>Place the potatoes in a large pot, and add <strong>3 quarts water</strong> and <strong>1/2 teaspoon salt</strong>. Cover with a lid and bring to a boil. Then reduce the heat to low and simmer until the potatoes are almost cooked through, about 5 minutes. Then add the <strong>cabbage</strong> and cook for 2 minutes more.</li>
    
            <li>Meanwhile, heat <strong>2 tablespoons oil</strong> in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add the <strong>onion</strong> with a <strong>pinch of salt</strong> and cook until it’s almost translucent, about 5 minutes. Then add the <strong>beets, carrots,</strong> and the remaining <strong>1/4 teaspoon salt</strong>. Cook until all the vegetables are soft and pastry, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes.</li>
    
            <li>Add <strong>4 tablespoons tomato paste, 2 tablespoons vinegar, and 1 tablespoon sugar</strong> to the beet mixture, and cook for 2 more minutes.</li>
    
            <li>Stir the beet mixture into the pot, along with <strong>10 peppercorns</strong>, and bring everything back to a boil. Then reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes.</li>
    
            <li>Turn the heat off, and stir in <strong>4 minced garlic cloves</strong> and <strong>a splash of lemon juice</strong>. Taste and season with more salt, sugar, and/or lemon, if needed.</li>
    
            <li>Serve hot, garnished with <strong>dill and sour cream</strong> if desired. (Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge and eat within 4 days.)</li>
        </ol>
