        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Kompot is a classic Eastern European homemade fruit beverage. You can make it with almost any fruit you have.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 pounds fruit of your choice</li>
            <li>4 cups filtered water</li>
            <li>2–4 tablespoons granulated sugar, to taste</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="steps">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Thoroughly wash all the fruit. Remove the cores/pits from all fruit and cut up into roughly 1-inch chunks.</li>
    
            <li>Place all the fruit in a medium pot and add 4 cups filtered water; the fruit should be just barely covered.</li>
    
            <li>Cover with a lid and bring to a boil. Then reduce the heat to low and simmer gently for 5 minutes.</li>
    
            <li>Turn the heat off and stir in 2 tablespoons sugar. (The kompot will taste pretty weak at this point.) Let the mixture stand until cooled – at least 2 hours. (Alternatively, you can cool it overnight in the fridge.) The drink will infuse during this time and intensify in flavor.</li>
            
            <li>Taste the kompot before serving and add more sugar if needed. Some people like to strain kompot before drinking, while others like to eat the fruit. Kompot can be served warm, at room temp, or cold. (I prefer it cold.) If you’re gonna leave the drink in the fridge to enjoy over a few days, leave the fruit inside as the flavor will keep intensifying. Consume within 4 days.</li>
